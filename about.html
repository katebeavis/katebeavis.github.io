  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    After working in the hospitality industry for seven years, I decided to give up my life as I knew it and make a career change into the technology industry.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I was offered a place at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" title="Makers Academy">Makers Academy</a>, a fully immersive, full-time computer programming course, where we covered a range of topics including Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, the command line and Git. We also lived and breathed Agile practices, pair programming, TDD, BDD and most importantly software craftmanship.

    After graduating in April 2015, I was immediately offered a job as an alumni helper. This involved assisting students with problem solving and logic, and helping to debug their code. I also mentored students individually on occasions.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    In July 2015, I was offered a Junior Software Engineer role at <a href="http://www.zopa.com/">Zopa</a>, Europe's first and largest peer to peer lending service, where I work today. At Zopa I focus mainly on Ruby on Rails, where I split my time between working on the lending aspect of the business, and prototyping and building new products.

    In my spare time I love to explore London, climb at Westway or go running in Regent's Park. Oh and I'm also a bit of a tube geek so if you see somebody photographing tube signs, it's probably me (125 and counting!)
